# How to contribute

The files in this repository are used as the starting point for all students. Because we want students to write the majority of the code themselves, pull requests (most likely) will _not_ be merged into the project.

For reference and a starting point because i wanted to use images and not icons, the following Git Repo was used: taniarascia/memory
