# Memory Game Project


## Object of the Game

The object of the game is to collect all the matching pairs.

This is a copycat of the classic Concentration memory match card game that is played with actual cards. Playing memory match games is a fun, effective way for adults and children to improve memory.

## How to Play

Click any card to overturn it, then overturn another card. If both are the same they are removed. Only two cards can be overturned at a time.
